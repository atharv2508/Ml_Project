# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, a popular dataset in the medical domain.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model using supervised learning techniques and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

- **Features:** 
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
- **Target:**
  - 0 = Non-diabetic
  - 1 = Diabetic
